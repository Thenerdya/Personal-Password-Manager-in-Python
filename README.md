üîê Personal Password Manager in Python
This project is a Password Manager built with Python to store, retrieve, and generate passwords securely. The program uses encryption and hashing to protect sensitive information like credentials and allows easy management of passwords via a command-line interface.

Features
User Authentication: Master password protection with bcrypt hashing.
Password Encryption: AES encryption using cryptography to secure stored passwords.
Secure Storage: Store website, username, and passwords in an SQLite database.
Password Generation: Generate secure random passwords.
Password Strength Check: Evaluate the strength of new passwords.
Credential Management: Add, update, delete, and view credentials securely.
Backup & Restore: Easily back up and restore encrypted credentials.
Technologies Used
bcrypt: For hashing the master password.
cryptography: For encrypting and decrypting the stored passwords.
SQLite: To store the credentials in an encrypted database.
secrets: To generate secure random passwords.
